	<p>MyBudgetYouth has been created by a Sheridan Postgraduate student with a background in accounting and finance. She created this web application in hopes of merging her past knowledge in business with what she's learning in her current program to create something fun and beneficial.</p>
	<p>Budgeting is an important skill to learn as everyone will eventually handle money. The earlier you learn, the better habits you'll keep a hold of.</p>
