	<p>Just like playing an instrument, knowing how to manage your money and credit better is a learned skill. But all too often it’s a skill that many of us haven’t had a chance to learn, let alone strengthen. Budget Buddy will help your youth learn about budgeting, how to do it, and why through an easy-to-understand simulation game. It will help you fine tune your money skills and increase your knowledge about personal finances.</p>

	<p>Record your income, expenditures, and how much you want to save, and we'll help you understand your next steps.</p>

	<p>Before starting, it's helpful to think about: your attitude towards money, how you feel about the state of your finances, and what you hope to achieve through this simulation.</p>
