	<p>Why should you save?</p>
		<p>At the moment, it may seem like you have an endless resource of money at the tip of your hand, but you never know when you need more until that time comes. Here are ten reasons why you should save:</p>
		<p>1. Become Financially Independent</p>
		<p>2. Save 50% on everything you buy + 24% on groceries</p>
		<p>3. Buy a Home</p>
		<p>4. Buy a Car</p>
		<p>5. Get out of Debt</p>
		<p>6. Annual Expenses</p>
		<p>7. Unforeseen Expenses</p>
		<p>8. Emergencies</p>
		<p>9. You could lose your job or get hurt</p>
		<p>10. To have a good life</p>


	<p>How do I save?</p>
		<p>There are many ways to start saving. Stay at home and cook a meal instead of going out. Make yourself a coffee at home instead of going to your local coffee shop. If you have an income, you can start setting aside a little money each pay cheque into a savings fund. It takes a bit of work, but it's a good habit to start.</p>
